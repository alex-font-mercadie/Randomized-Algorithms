# Galton Box Simulation

This project simulates a Galton box and compares the resulting binomial distribution to a normal distribution. It calculates the mean squared error (MSE) between the two distributions.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- C++ Standard Library (should be available with any standard C++ compiler)

## Compilation

To compile the `galtonbox.cc` file, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o galtonbox galtonbox.cc
